The videos are also superb quality and the teachers are very encouraging.  Their courses cover a wide variety of technologies and languages.\r\n\r\nNext, you can pay about $500/year to get additional, more advanced materials and take quizzes and code challenges.  \r\n\r\nLastly, you have the tech degree program which is much more expensive, but is more intense and for those who seriously want to pursue software developer jobs.  \r\n\r\nI also like that they are completely online.  Sure, you lose out on networking with individuals in person, but it's also very convenient.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n","reviewer_name":"christopheralan88","overall_experience_rating":5,"course_curriculum_rating":5,"course_instructors_rating":5,"school_job_assistance_rating":null,"created_at":"2017-01-20T16:06:48.381-05:00"}]}}
