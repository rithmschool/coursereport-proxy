{"post":{"id":1120,"title":"Ultimate Guide to Learning Blockchain ","body":"So you’ve probably heard that Blockchain is taking over the world, but what is Blockchain? And how can you become a Blockchain developer? In this guide we look at the definition of blockchain, the growth of the blockchain industry, what sort of jobs exist in blockchain, how much you can earn on a blockchain salary, and which skills you’ll learn to become a blockchain developer. Plus, our picks for the best blockchain bootcamps, and coding bootcamps which cover blockchain in their curriculum.\r\n\r\nWhat is Blockchain Development?\r\n\r\nA blockchain is a distributed ledger system with immutable data add-only functionality. Essentially, blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, and trustless database. Blockchain is an ‘add-on’ system where the most recent transactions are constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks, and they are recorded and added in chronological order. The cool thing about using Blockchain is that users can keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. So think about it like this – there’s no one single place this digital information is being held, it’s distributed all across the world!\r\n\r\nCurrently, Blockchain technology is primarily used to verify transactions within digital currencies, but it is possible to digitize, code and insert practically any document into the blockchain. To ensure that the process is secure, when you enter the document, it creates an indelible record that cannot be changed. Then, the record or transaction authenticity can be verified by the entire community using the Blockchain instead of a single centralized authority.\r\n\r\nThe Blockchain Economy\r\n\r\nIt’s safe to say that the industry is seeing tremendous growth – here’s what we know:\r\n\r\n\r\nRevenues in the global blockchain market are expected to be $20 billion by 2024! This is a significant increase from $315.9 million revenue gain in 2015. Gartner forecasts the business value-add of blockchain will exceed $3.1 trillion by 2030.\n\r\nBlockchain wallet users grew from 3 million in 2015 to 28 million in 2018!\r\n\nAbout 23% of larger enterprises are now actively working on Blockchain apps.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe market is mainly being driven by mammoth investments made by several startups companies working in the same field, but as time goes on, you can expect that a more crowded market.\r\n\r\nBlockchain and Cryptocurrency\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency refers to digital or virtual currency used for the buying and selling of goods. Originally, Blockchain was developed as the accounting method for the virtual currency, Bitcoin. But because blockchains are known as distributed ledger technology (DLT) and are seen in a variety of commercial applications today, there are many other cryptocurrencies in the market like Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and more.\r\n\r\nOther Uses for Blockchain\r\n\r\nBlockchain development is not just for cryptocurrency; as the industry has evolved, various fields can utilize blockchain. Some other uses for Blockchain include:\r\n\r\n\r\nSupply Chain Management: streamlining the buying and selling of goods\r\nIdentity Control: digital passports or online voting\r\nContracts\r\nQualification records\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills for Blockchain Developers\r\n\r\nGeneral skills that make software developers stand out can be transferred to Blockchain developers. Here are a few specific skills that will make Blockchain developers excel in their role, according to IBM:\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn how to drive business outcomes\r\nCollaboration and Negotiation Skills\r\nLedger Expertise\r\nUnderstand Blockchain security\r\nBe comfortable learning as you go\r\n\r\n\r\nWondering where to focus your efforts? Here are some of the top programming languages used in Blockchain development:\r\n\r\n\r\nC++\r\nJava\r\nPython\r\nSimplicity\r\nSolidity\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here are some of the top Blockchain Platforms and Systems:\r\n\r\n\r\nBitcoin\r\nEthereum\r\nSpark Solidity\r\nHyperledger\r\nRipple\r\n\r\n\r\nJobs in Blockchain\r\n\r\nSince the Blockchain Industry is on the rise, we’re sure job titles in the field will change. Right now, here are some of the top Blockchain job titles:\r\n\r\n\r\nBlockchain Project Manager\r\nBlockchain Developer\r\nBlockchain Quality Engineer\r\nBlockchain Web Designer\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of coding bootcamp grads who already work in Blockchain:\r\n\r\n\r\nHack Reactor grad Dan Miller\r\nNatalie Villasana of Digital Crafts\r\n\r\n\r\nAverage Salaries for Blockchain Developers\r\n\r\nDeveloping blockchain distributed ledgers for businesses was recently ranked first among the top 20 fastest-growing job skills – and job postings for workers with those skills grew more than 200% last year. Because there are currently only a few qualified candidates with Blockchain knowledge, it’s not surprising that salaries for blockchain positions are typically higher than in other specialized technical areas. Average Blockchain salaries range from $40,000 to $150,000. Here’s a breakdown of average Blockchain developer salaries for established firms and startups:\r\n\r\n\r\nBlockchain Developer: $85k at startups and $110k at established firms\r\nBlockchain Management: $40k at startups and $125k at established firms\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Top Blockchain Development Bootcamps\r\n\r\nSo are you ready to start learning Blockchain?
